## <span style="font-size: 1.6em;">👨‍💻 The Story So Far</span>

<span style="font-size: 1.1em;">I'm not just building AI systems—I'm architecting the **next generation of intelligent platforms** that bridge quantum computing, blockchain, and deep learning. Currently pursuing B.Tech in AI & Data Science at Anna University, I've already shipped production-grade systems that are redefining healthcare consent, quantum optimization, and cybersecurity.</span>

<span style="font-size: 1.1em;">**What drives me?** The intersection of impossibly hard problems and elegant solutions. Whether it's optimizing quantum circuits with graph neural networks or building AI agents that understand medical documentation, I thrive where innovation meets impact.</span>
